## Summary

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is an annual Advent calendar of programming puzzles. This repository houses my solutions to these festive coding challenges, bringing together a collection of creative and efficient approaches to tackle each problem.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is not just about solving puzzles; it's a celebration of problem-solving, creativity, and community spirit. Each day in December, a new coding challenge is revealed, covering a range of algorithmic and programming concepts. It's an opportunity for programmers of all skill levels to come together, learn, and share their solutions.
